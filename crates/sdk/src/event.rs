/// Trait for individual event structs.
///
/// Each event knows its type name and which fields are domain identifiers.
/// Domain IDs identify which entity an event belongs to for consistency purposes. Reference fields (who you sent to, who you received from) are just data—not domain IDs.
/// Ask yourself: "If this field changes, does it affect a different entity's consistency boundary?"
/// If yes, emit a separate event for that entity instead of adding another domain ID.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// #[derive(Event, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
/// #[event_type("SentFunds")]
/// pub struct SentFunds {
///     #[domain_id]
///     pub account_id: String,
///     pub amount: f64,
///     pub recipient_id: String,
/// }

/// 2. Deserialize events into the correct variant
